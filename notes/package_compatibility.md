There are several effective ways to check dependency compatibility with Python packages, especially for Python 3.12. Here are the most practical approaches:

## GitHub Actions Approach

The most robust method is using GitHub Actions to test against multiple Python versions and dependency combinations:## Local Testing Tools

For local development and testing, here are several useful tools:

### 1. **pip-tools** for dependency resolution
```bash
pip install pip-tools
pip-compile requirements.in  # Generates locked requirements.txt
pip-sync requirements.txt    # Installs exact versions
```

### 2. **pipdeptree** for dependency analysis
```bash
pip install pipdeptree
pipdeptree --warn conflict   # Shows conflicts
pipdeptree --reverse         # Shows what depends on what
```

### 3. **pip check** (built-in)
```bash
pip check  # Verifies installed packages have compatible dependencies
```

### 4. **Safety** for security scanning
```bash
pip install safety
safety check  # Scans for known security vulnerabilities
```

## Python 3.12 Specific Considerations

For Python 3.12 compatibility:

1. **Use `pyproject.toml`** with proper version constraints:
```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=45", "wheel"]

[project]
name = "your-package"
requires-python = ">=3.9"
dependencies = [
    "numpy>=1.21.0;python_version>='3.9'",
    "pandas>=1.3.0",
]
```

2. **Test with `tox`** for multiple environments:
```ini
[tox]
envlist = py39,py310,py311,py312

[testenv]
deps =
    pytest
    -r requirements-dev.txt
commands = pytest tests/
```

## Automated Dependency Updates

Consider using **Dependabot** in your GitHub repository by adding `.github/dependabot.yml`:

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    target-branch: "develop"
```

The GitHub Actions approach is most comprehensive as it automatically tests your code against different Python versions and dependency scenarios, catching compatibility issues before they reach production. The weekly scheduled runs help catch new incompatibilities as dependencies are updated.
